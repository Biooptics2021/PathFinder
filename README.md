## PathFinder: Cancer biomarker discovery via AI
* WSI_decoupling: *Get the macro mode (3D-numpy-array of multi-class tissue probability heatmaps) of WSIs.*
* Prognosis: *Train prognostic deep neural networks (MacroNet, MicroNet and M2MNet) for cancer prognosis.*
* Discovery: *Use attribution methods to find important features for further analyses and discovery.*

### Pre-requisites:
* Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 18.04)
* NVIDIA GPU (Tested on Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 x 4)
* Python (3.7.9),PyTorch (version 1.8.0), Lifelines (version 0.25.11), NumPy (version 1.19.2), Pandas (version 1.2.2), Albumentations (version 0.5.2), OpenCV (version 4.5.1), Pillow (version 7.2.0), OpenSlide (version 1.1.2), Captum (version 0.2.0), SciPy (version 1.4.1), Seaborn (version 0.9.0), Matplotlib (version 3.1.1).

### Data Preparation
* WSIs and clinical information of patients are used in this project. Raw WSIs are stored as ```.svs```, ```.mrxs``` or ```.tiff``` files. Clinical information are stored as ```.csv``` files. 
* WSIs are first processed by PaSegNet to get multi-class tissue probability heatmaps (macro mode), which sorted as ```.npy``` files.
The macro mode of WSIs can be by generated by calling:
    ``` shell
    cd ./WSI_decoupling
    python decoupling.py
    ```
    To cut the empty area of macro mode and get square input for training, call:
    ``` shell
    cd ./Prognosis/Data_prepare
    python cut_heatmap.py
    ```
* Tumor pathces (micro mode) are extracted based on macro mode and WSIs, and stored as ```.tif``` files. 
The micro mode of WSIs can be by generated by calling:
    ``` shell
    cd ./Prognosis/Data_prepare
    python Generate_prognostic_patches.py
    ```
* Macro mode and clinical information is used to train ```MacroNet```, micro mode and clinical information is used to train ```MicroNet```, both macro mode, micro mode and clinical information is used to train ```M2MNet```. 
The Data distribution is like:

DATA_ROOT_DIR is the base directory of all datasets (e.g. the directory to your SSD). DATASET_DIR is the name of the folder containing data specific to one experiment.


### Training & Evaluation
After data preparation, MacroNet can be trained and tested on TCGA data in a cross-validation by calling:
``` shell
cd ./Prognosis
python train_TCGA_CV.py
```
The generalization ability of MacroNet can be tested by calling:
``` shell
cd ./Prognosis
python train_TCGA_test_QHCG.py
```
To train and evaluate MicroNet and M2MNet, import corresponding data loader and network architecture in ```./Prognosis/train_test.py```. Data loaders can be found in ```./Prognosis/data_loaders.py```, network architectures can be found in ```./Prognosis/Networks```.


### Biomarker discovery
To explore the features networks focus on, run ```./Discovery/attribution.ipynb```.
